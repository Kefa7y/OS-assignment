# OS mini Operating system
<p>In this project, you are building a tiny yet functional operating system similar to CP/M 1 from scratch.
The operating system that you will implement is intended to ﬁt on a 3 1/2 inch ﬂoppy disk,
and to be bootable on any normal x86 PC.
The operating system is programmed primarily in C with a small amount of assembly functions.
It contains no externally written functions or libraries; all the code is written exclusively for this project.</p>
